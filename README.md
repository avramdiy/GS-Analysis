### 1st Commit

- Created a Flask API in `app/data.py` that loads the `gs.us.txt` CSV file using pandas and displays the Goldman Sachs stock data as an interactive HTML dataframe table with Bootstrap styling. The API includes a root route (`/`) that renders the data with metadata showing the date range and total number of records.
